# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a Python implementation of Iris flower classification using machine learning techniques. The Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, is used to classify iris flowers into three species based on measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the use of various classification algorithms to predict the species of Iris flowers. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The following classification algorithms are implemented:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## Project Structure

- `iris_classification.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `iris_data.csv` - CSV file with the Iris dataset (if not using the built-in dataset).
- `requirements.txt` - List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
